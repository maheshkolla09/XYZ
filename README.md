Create a repo
To put your project up on GitHub, you'll need to create a repository for it to live in.

You can store a variety of projects in GitHub repositories, including open source projects. With open source projects, you can share code to make better, more reliable software.

Note: You can create public repositories for an open source project. When creating your public repository, make sure to include a license file that determines how you want your project to be shared with others. For more information on open source, specifically how to create and grow an open source project, we've created Open Source Guides that will help you foster a healthy open source community by recommending best practices for creating and maintaining repositories for your open source project. You can also take a free GitHub Learning Lab course on maintaining open source communities.

New repository menuIn the upper-right corner of any page, click , and then click New repository.

Field for entering a repository nameType a short, memorable name for your repository. For example, "hello-world".

Field for entering a repository descriptionOptionally, add a description of your repository. For example, "My first repository on GitHub."
Choose between creating a public or private repository.
Public repositories are a great choice for getting started. They're visible to any user on GitHub, so you can benefit from a collaborative community.
Radio buttons to select private or public statusPrivate repositories require a little more setup. They're only available to you, the repository owner, as well as any collaborators you choose to share with. Private repositories are only available for paid accounts. For more information, see "GitHub's billing plans."
Checkbox to create a README when the repository is createdSelect Initialize this repository with a README.
Click Create repository.
Congratulations! You've successfully created your first repository, and initialized it with a README file.
